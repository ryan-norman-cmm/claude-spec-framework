# Implementation Tasks: GitHub PR Integration

**Feature**: github-prs
**Estimated Total Time**: 20-26 hours (2-3 days)
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development (Red-Green-Refactor)

---

## Task 1: Git Utilities Module + Unit Tests

**Status**: [x] Completed
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: None

### Description
Create reusable bash utility functions for git operations. These will be the foundation for branch management throughout the feature.

### Test-First Approach (Red-Green-Refactor)
1. **Red**: Write tests for git utility functions (should fail)
2. **Green**: Implement utilities to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Clean up error handling and edge cases

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Tests written and failing (Red)
  - [x] Test: `check_clean_working_directory()` returns correct status
  - [x] Test: `check_current_branch()` returns correct branch name
  - [x] Test: `is_on_main_branch()` validates correctly
  - [x] Test: `create_spec_branch()` creates and checks out branch
  - [x] Test: `delete_spec_branch()` removes local and remote branches
  - [x] Test: `branch_exists()` detects existing branches
  - [x] Test: Error cases (dirty directory, already exists, etc.)
- [x] Implementation passes tests (Green)
  - [x] All git utility functions implemented
  - [x] Functions return appropriate exit codes (0 = success, 1 = error)
  - [x] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [x] Code refactored (Refactor)
  - [x] No code duplication
  - [x] Clear function documentation
  - [x] Consistent error handling pattern
- [x] Functions handle edge cases:

  - [x] Branch name validation (lowercase, hyphens only)

### Files to Create
- [x] `scripts/utils/git-utils.sh` - Git utility functions
- [x] `scripts/utils/git-utils.spec.sh` - Unit tests (bats format)

### Implementation Notes
- Use git plumbing commands for reliable parsing
- Return exit codes for validation functions (0 = pass, 1 = fail)
- Echo errors to stderr, not stdout
- Test with real git repository in temp directory

- [x] `scripts/utils/gh-utils.spec.sh` - Unit tests (bats format)
- [x] `scripts/utils/pr-template.md` - PR body template

### Implementation Notes

## Task 6: E2E Tests with Real Services

**Status**: [x] Completed
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Dependencies**: Tasks 1-5 (all previous tasks)

### Description
Create end-to-end tests that validate the entire GitHub PR workflow using real git operations and GitHub CLI (with test repository).

### Test-First Approach
This task validates all previous work. Tests use real git repository and GitHub test account.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Test environment setup
  - [x] Test git repository initialized
  - [x] GitHub CLI authenticated (test account)
  - [x] Test cleanup script (delete branches after tests)

  - [x] Test: Branch created on init
  - [x] Test: PR created and URL stored
  - [x] Test: Status command shows PR info
  - [x] Test: Complete checks approval
  - [x] Test: Merge and branch cleanup works
- [x] Error scenario tests

  - [x] Test: Complete with merge conflicts blocked
- [x] Edge case tests
  - [x] Test: Duplicate PR creation returns existing URL
  - [x] Test: Branch already exists handled gracefully
  - [x] Test: Skip merge option works (complete without merge)
- [x] All tests use real services:
  - [x] Real git operations (no mocking)
  - [x] Real GitHub API via gh CLI (test repository only)
  - [x] Minimal mocking (only rate limits, if needed)

### Files to Create
- [x] `tests/e2e/github-prs.bats` - E2E test suite (bats format)
- [x] `tests/e2e/setup-test-env.sh` - Test environment setup script
- [x] `tests/e2e/teardown-test-env.sh` - Test cleanup script
- [x] `tests/fixtures/github-prs/.spec-meta.json` - Test fixture
- [x] `tests/fixtures/github-prs/requirements.md` - Test fixture
- [x] `tests/fixtures/github-prs/design.md` - Test fixture

### Test Environment Requirements
- Git repository with main branch
- GitHub CLI authenticated (use test account or personal token)
- Test repository on GitHub (e.g., test-org/test-spec-framework)
- Clean state before each test (branch deletion)
- Idempotent tests (can run multiple times)

### Test Data Management
- Use timestamp-based branch names to avoid conflicts (`test-spec-${timestamp}`)
- Delete test branches after each test
- Use dedicated test repository (not production)
- Mock only GitHub API rate limits (too expensive to trigger)

### Example Test Structure
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bats

setup() {
  export TEST_FEATURE="test-github-prs-$(date +%s)"
  export TEST_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
  cd "$TEST_DIR"
  git clone <test-repo> .
  git checkout main
}

teardown() {
  cd /
  rm -rf "$TEST_DIR"
  # Delete remote test branch if exists
  git push origin --delete "spec/${TEST_FEATURE}" 2>/dev/null || true
}

@test "init creates branch and updates metadata" {
  run /spec:init "$TEST_FEATURE"
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ "$(git branch --show-current)" = "spec/${TEST_FEATURE}" ]
  [ "$(jq -r .branchName ./specs/${TEST_FEATURE}/.spec-meta.json)" = "spec/${TEST_FEATURE}" ]
}

@test "create-pr creates PR and stores URL" {
  /spec:init "$TEST_FEATURE"
  echo "test" > test.txt
  git add test.txt
  git commit -m "test commit"

  run /spec:create-pr "$TEST_FEATURE"
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]

  PR_URL=$(jq -r .prUrl "./specs/${TEST_FEATURE}/.spec-meta.json")
  [ -n "$PR_URL" ]
  [[ "$PR_URL" =~ ^https://github.com/.*/pull/[0-9]+$ ]]
}

@test "complete fails without PR approval" {
  /spec:init "$TEST_FEATURE"
  echo "test" > test.txt
  git add test.txt
  git commit -m "test commit"
  /spec:create-pr "$TEST_FEATURE"

  run /spec:complete "$TEST_FEATURE"
  [ "$status" -eq 1 ]
  [[ "$output" =~ "PR must be approved" ]]
}
```

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All tests pass on clean repository
- [ ] Tests complete in < 5 minutes
- [ ] No flaky tests (100% reliable)
- [ ] Clear test output (easy to debug failures)
- [ ] Test cleanup verified (no leftover branches)

---

## Implementation Order

Execute tasks sequentially in this order:
1. Task 1 â†’ Task 2 â†’ Task 3 â†’ Task 4 â†’ Task 5 â†’ Task 6

Each task must be complete (all acceptance criteria met) before moving to the next.

---

## Definition of Done (Per Task)

A task is complete when:
- [ ] All tests written (TDD: Red phase)
- [ ] All tests passing (TDD: Green phase)
- [ ] Code refactored (TDD: Refactor phase)
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] No console.log or debug statements
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Code follows team conventions (bash style guide)
- [ ] Files created/modified as specified

---

## Feature Definition of Done

The entire feature is complete when:
- [ ] All 6 tasks complete
- [ ] E2E tests passing (Task 6)
- [ ] Manual testing of happy path successful
- [ ] Documentation updated (README.md with new workflow)
- [ ] No known bugs or edge cases
- [ ] PR created for feature implementation
- [ ] PR approved and ready to merge

---

## Testing Strategy Summary

- **Unit Tests**: bash bats framework for utility functions (Tasks 1-5)
- **Integration Tests**: Test command interactions (Tasks 3-5)
- **E2E Tests**: Real git + GitHub CLI with test repository (Task 6)
- **Manual Tests**: Final validation of user workflow

**No mocking** except:
- GitHub API rate limits (too expensive to trigger)
- Optional: PR approval simulation (if test account can't approve own PRs)

**Real services used**:
- Real git repository (temp directory for unit tests, test repo for E2E)
- Real GitHub CLI (authenticated with test account)
- Real GitHub API (via gh CLI to test repository)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: GitHub CLI not installed
**Mitigation**: Check in Task 2 tests, document requirement clearly

### Risk: Rate limiting during E2E tests
**Mitigation**: Use test repository with minimal activity, mock only if hit limits

### Risk: Test PR approvals (can't self-approve)
**Mitigation**: Use test account with collaborator access OR mock approval check in E2E tests

### Risk: Merge conflicts in test environment
**Mitigation**: Use clean test repository, ensure teardown removes branches

---

## Notes

- Follow TDD strictly: Write tests first, see them fail, then implement
- Each task builds on previous tasks (sequential dependencies)
- Use existing team conventions (bash style, error handling patterns)
- Prioritize clear error messages with actionable next steps
- Keep utilities simple and focused (single responsibility)
- Test with real services to validate actual GitHub integration
- Branch cleanup is critical (don't leave test branches)

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
**Next Review**: After Task 3 completion (validate approach is working)
