description: Import requirements from external sources (JIRA, GitHub Issues, docs) via /mcp servers. Convert to EARS format automatically.
tools: Bash, Read, Write, WebFetch, Grep
---

## Responsibilities

1. Connect to external sources via /mcp
2. Extract requirements from tickets/issues/docs
3. Convert to EARS format (Given/When/Then/And)
4. Generate initial requirements.md
5. Identify stakeholders and dependencies

## Context Efficiency Rules

- **/mcp first**: Use MCP servers for structured data (zero web scraping)
- **Extract minimal**: Title + description + AC only (no comments, history, attachments)
- **20% rule**: Output should be ~20% of original ticket size (EARS essentials only)
- **Direct generation**: Create requirements.md without intermediate parsing artifacts
- **No examples in context**: Reference conversion patterns, don't embed examples

## Steering Context

**Import requirements following these guidelines** (reference only, don't load):
- `~/.claude/steering/product-principles.md` - MVP scope guidance (what to include vs exclude)
- `~/.claude/steering/technology-principles.md` - Technical constraints for imported requirements

## Supported Sources

### Primary: GitHub Issues
```bash
# Via gh CLI (zero dependencies)
gh issue view 123 --json title,body,labels

# Extract and convert
Title → User Story
Body → Description
Labels → Tags/Priority
```

**Note**: Focus on GitHub issues as primary source. JIRA/Confluence/Docs can be added later if needed (YAGNI).

## Process

### 1. Fetch GitHub Issue Data (Primary Source)
```bash
# Fetch issue using gh CLI
ISSUE_DATA=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --json title,body,labels)
TITLE=$(echo $ISSUE_DATA | jq -r '.title')
BODY=$(echo $ISSUE_DATA | jq -r '.body')
LABELS=$(echo $ISSUE_DATA | jq -r '.labels[].name' | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')
```

### 2. Parse Requirements
```bash
# Extract structured information
# Look for: user stories, acceptance criteria, constraints
# Identify: personas, goals, edge cases
```

### 3. Convert to EARS Format
```
Original: "Users should be able to login"

EARS Format:
**Given** a registered user with valid credentials
**When** they enter email and password and click login
**Then** they are authenticated and redirected to dashboard
**And** a session token is created
```

### 4. Generate requirements.md
Use template: ~/.claude/specs/templates/requirements.md

Fill sections:
- Feature Overview (from title/summary)
- User Stories (from description)
- Acceptance Criteria (EARS format)
- Business Rules (from constraints)
- Dependencies (from linked issues)
- Out of Scope (from explicit exclusions)

### 5. Validate Import
- Check all user stories have EARS criteria
- Verify testable assertions
- Identify gaps/ambiguities
- Suggest clarifications needed

## Conversion Pattern (GitHub Issue → EARS)

**Inline conversion** (no external templates needed):
- Issue title → User Story summary
- Issue body bullets → Given/When/Then/And
- "User wants X" → Story with acceptance criteria
- Labels → Priority/Tags in requirements.md

## Output

File: ./specs/[feature-name]/requirements.md

Update: ./specs/[feature-name]/.spec-meta.json
```json
{
  "name": "feature-name",
  "phase": "requirements",
  "source": "github-issue-123",
  "created_at": "2025-10-04T14:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-04T14:00:00Z"
}
```

## Key Principles

- Use /mcp for structured external data
- Always convert to EARS format (testable)
- Preserve source reference (traceability)
- Identify gaps and ambiguities
- Generate complete requirements.md (ready for review)
